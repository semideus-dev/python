Python comes pre-installed with a code editor called IDLE. You can choose any code editor of your choice (Zed, VSCode, Sublime etc.) or and IDE like PyCharm if you are familiar with it.

For the sake of simplicity we will use IDLE to begin and in the next chapter, we will setup a development environment using VSCode, Zed and PyCharm.

### Using IDLE

Open the applications manager for you operating system and search for "IDLE". You should see a python shell with the current installed version of it.

This screen acts as an output screen for you python programs. To create a new file you can click on the "File" tab or press `Ctrl + N`  or `Cmd + N` depending your OS. Before writing any code lets save this file on our computer using `Ctrl + S` or `Cmd + S`. All python files end with a `.py` extension.

A Python file contains the instructions which will be run by the interpreter and output will be visible inside the shell. Lets try a basic `print` command:

```
print("hello world!")
```

You can execute this file by saving it and pressing the `F5` function key. You can also run the program from the "Run" tab. Once executed, you should see "hello world" being printed inside the shell.
