A development environment is your workspace where you write, run and debug programs. Every developer has their own preferences on how they setup their workspace and what tools are used inside that workspace.

In this chapter, we will see different development environments and you can choose which workspaces suits you the best.

### VSCode

As of right now, VSCode is the most popular choice for a primary code editor. To install VSCode, you can directly go to the [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Once installed, you will also need to install the official [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) and you ready to go.

### PyCharm

PyCharm is an IDE and not a code editor. It is a industry-standard software and used for heavy weight projects but can easily be used for any python related project no matter the scale. There really is no setup required for it, all you need to do is install it from the [Jetbrains website](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/).

### Zed

Zed is lightweight and relatively new alternative to VS Code. It is much easier on your computer's memory and is written in Rust, making it blazingly fast. It also has built in Python support and you can download it from [here](https://zed.dev/download).
