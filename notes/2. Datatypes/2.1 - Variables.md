Variables are used a containers to store data values. To declare a variable in Python, simply type the name and assign a value to it

```
name = "Semideus"

print(name)
```

You can also redeclare a variable after its initial declaration. 

```
name = "Semideus"
print(name) # OUTPUT -> Semideus

name = "Semideus.dev"
print(name) # OUTPUT -> Semideus.dev
```

Python is a case sensitive language. Hence `name` and `Name` are treated as two different variables.

```
name = "Semideus"
print(name) # OUTPUT -> Semideus

Name = "Semideus.dev"
print(name) # OUTPUT -> Semideus
```

For variables having multiple name, we use **Snake Case** to declare them but it is a preference and not a compulsion.

```
# Snake case
is_human = True 

# Camel case
isHuman = True
```

While declaring variables in Python, the variable name cannot include any space, hyphen (-) or hashtag and also cannot start with a number.

```
# Follow code will produce a syntax error

2age = 10
my-name = "Semideus"
my full name = "Semideus.dev"
```
