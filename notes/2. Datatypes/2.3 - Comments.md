Comments are lines of code which are ignored during execution. In Python, any line of code starting from `#` will be ignored by the interpreter

```
# print("hello world") this code will not executed
```

Comments are usually used for writing notes or explaining a code block. For a multi-line comment, we can use triple quotation marks.

```
'''
this is a multi line comment.
none of this code will be executed.
'''
```
