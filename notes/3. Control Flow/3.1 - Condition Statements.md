These statements provide a **choice** for the control flow based on a condition. It means that the control **flow of the program** will be decided based on the **outcome of the condition**.

### `if` 

If the simple code of block is to be performed if the condition holds then the `if` statement is used.

```
age = 14

if age < 18:
	print("You cannot own a driving license")
```

### `else`

In a conditional `if` statement the additional block of code is merged as an `else` statement which is performed when `if` condition is false.

```
age = 14

if age < 18:
	print("You cannot own a driving license")
else:
	print("You can own a driving license")
```

### `elif`

`If` statements are checked top to bottom. Once a condition is true, its block runs, and the rest are skipped. If none are true, the `else` block runs.

```
marks = 85

if marks >= 90:
    print("A+")
elif marks >= 75:
    print("A")
elif marks >= 50:
	print("B")
else:
	print("F")
```

### Nested `if else`

You have multiple `if` and `else` statements inside the `if else`  statement. This is called nesting. 

```
marks = 85

if marks >= 50:  
    if marks >= 90: 
        print("A+")
    elif marks >= 75:  
        print("A")
    else:  
        print("B")
else:
    print("F")
```
