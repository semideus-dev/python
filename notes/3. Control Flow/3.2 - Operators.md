Operators in general are used to perform operations on values and variables.

### Arithmetic Operators

These operators are used to perform basic mathematical calculations.

```
a = 22
b = 12

print(a+b)  # Addition
print(a-b)  # Subtraction
print(a*b)  # Multiplication
print(a/b)  # Division (float)
print(a//b) # Division (floor)
print(a%b)  # Modulus
print(a**b) # Power
```

The precedence of arithmetic operators is:
- P – Parentheses
- E – Exponentiation
- M – Multiplication (Multiplication and division have the same precedence)
- D – Division
- A – Addition (Addition and subtraction have the same precedence)
- S – Subtraction

### Comparison Operators

These operators are used to compare values against each other.

```
a = 22
b = 12

print(a>b)  # Greater than
print(a<b)  # Less than
print(a==b) # Equal to
print(a!=b) # Not equal to
print(a>=b) # Greater than or equal to
print(a<=b) # Less than or equal to
```

### Logical Operators

These operators are used to combine conditional statements, allowing you to perform operations based on multiple conditions.

```
age = 25
has_id = True

# AND: Both conditions must be True
if age >= 21 and has_id:
    print("Eligible to enter the club.")

# OR: At least one condition must be True
if age < 18 or age > 60:
    print("Eligible for a discount.")

# NOT: Reverses the condition
if not has_id:
    print("ID is required.")
```

### Assignment Operators

These operators are used to assign values to a variable. While there is only one assignment operator, `=`, it can be combined with other operators to perform an operation before assigning the resulting value.

```
a = 22
a += 12

print(a) # Output -> 22 + 12 = 34
```

### Identity Operators

These operators are used to check if two values are located on the same part of the memory. Two variables that are equal do not imply that they are identical.

```
a = 22
b = 12
c = 22
d = a

print(a is not b) # True
print(a is c)     # True
print(a is d)     # True
```

### Membership Operators

These operators are used to test whether a value or variable is in a sequence.

```
a = 22
b = 12

nums = [10, 12, 14, 16, 18]

print(a not in nums) # True
print(b in nums)     # True
```
