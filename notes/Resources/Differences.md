#### Complier vs Interpreter

| Compiler                                                                   | Interpreter                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Converts the entire program file into machine code before executing it     | Converts the program line by line into machine code              |
| It slows down the development process but the the compiled program is fast | It improves development time but the interpreted program is slow |
| Errors and debugging can only be done after compilation                    | Errors and debugging can be done on the go.                      |

#### Mutable vs Immutable

| Mutable                                                                           | Immutable                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mutable data types are those whose values can be modified after they are created. | Immutable data types are those whose values cannot be modified once created |
| e.g. Lists, Dictionaries                                                          | e.g. Tuples, Strings                                                        |
